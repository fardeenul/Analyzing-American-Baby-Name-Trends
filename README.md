# Analyzing-American-Baby-Name-Trends
The project aims to analyze American baby name trends and popularity changes since 1920 using data provided by the United States Social Security Administration. The dataset includes first names along with the number and sex of babies they were given to in each year, limited to names given to over 5,000 babies in a year.

Key objectives of the project are:

1. Understanding changes in American baby name tastes over time.
2. Identifying names that have remained popular for over 100 years.
3. Comparing the popularity of these long-standing names with more recent top baby names.

By analyzing the dataset spanning 101 years, the project will provide insights into naming trends and patterns that can be valuable not only for new parents but also for businesses interested in understanding trends and popularity in various domains.

The analysis will involve querying the dataset to extract relevant information, such as the total number of babies given each name, classifying names based on popularity, identifying top names for each year, and examining the longevity of certain names.

The project will provide a comprehensive understanding of how American baby name tastes have evolved over the years, which names have stood the test of time, and how recent top names compare to those with a longer history of popularity.
